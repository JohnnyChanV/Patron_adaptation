For both of these, you gave once sentence following as to why that example supports his arguement. I feel that these two sentences are very close to summarization. In the ad space example, you said, ''using nature as ad space is what ruins the relationship between nature and humans.'' This is vauge. What details in the example are ''ruining'' the realtionship between nature and humans? Why would having an example of ads, when Louv could of chosen other things, support his arguement better?  In your second body paragraph, you said Louv provides imagery of looking out the car window which evokes a sense of pathos. But how does evoking a sense of pathos in the audience help strengthen Louvs arguement?  In your third body paragraph, you said Louv employs allusions to what kids his age did when they were in a car.

Your second body paragraph begins well with strong commentary relating to the question (although the sentence after could use grammar work).

However, the discussion of each one of them is not full enough to completely demonstrate how they relate to Louv's purpose.  For example, the first body paragraph, which is supposed to discuss the anecdote, is basically just a summary of the story that Louv's friend tells in the passage; only obvious commentary is given as to what the anecdote actually does in relation to what Louv has to say about the separation between people and nature. So, although the identification of devices is correct, their application to Louv's purpose is often not that clear.  This could be solved by providing better commentary and analysis of the devices.  For example, when the writer identifies Louv's incorporation of an oxymoron, the writer comments that it revealed that Louv ''did not consider time spent staring out the window as time wasted''; but then, he/she does not tie this back to what the prompt is asking for.  Thus, the analysis could be improved if the writer perhaps stated why Louv felt ''staring out the window'' was valuable and what exactly future generations would be losing by severing their connection with nature."}

I also think that you missed a major feeling of guilt that would fit perfectly in this paragraph. try to analyze how the emotions that the audience is feeling help Kelley. Also in your analysis for rhetorical questions, I think you can do more analysis here.

Louv isn&rsquo;t employing metaphors to highlight the &ldquo;dwindling attention span&rdquo; of people&rdquo; he employs metaphors to illustrate how nature and children have become separated, once again I iterate,  this is the purpose you highlighted in your thesis, stick with it, especially for your topic sentence.   Also when she states &ldquo;that advertisers are the ones who are distorting the minds of the public by drawing people&rsquo;s attention to their products by providing ads that replace the visual appeal of nature&rdquo; this is somewhat true but I feel like advertisers aren&rsquo;t distorting the minds of consumers by drawing their attention, I think the advertisers are just abusing nature&rsquo;s value and magnitude by reducing it to an advertisement, they are creating nature as a canvas for advertising rather than an institution that provides children with an appreciation for the real world rather than the virtual world.  I think the second part of your analysis is true but how does replacing the visual appeal create separation? When you make nature superficial, and skew its natural beauty you give children the opportunity to treat nature nothing more than a means of marketing, creating a decreased value in nature, which as a results causes separation through their perception.

The author is missing the word ''but'' in between ''hours'' and ''she'', and the phrase ''children are not treated unfairly'' should be changed to ''children are treated fairly'' as it is an awkward double negative. In addition, the author occasionally uses contractions, which could have been changed with simple proofreading: ''...the subjects of terrible abuse due to the harmful conditions where they'd work and the relentless hours of labor expected of them''.

My biggest issue with this is that, not only should ethos have its own paragraph, as it is an entirely different rhetorical strategy, but you don't actually mention an appeal to ethos anywhere in the paragraph, except for in the first and last sentence. For this, my recommendation would be to simply focus on one strategy per paragraph, and if you can only make two strong body paragraphs, that's still fine. My other recommendation for your analysis in this paragraph is focusing less on what she is saying, and more on why she is saying it, and why it's effective. For instance, much of your commentary in that paragraph is simply explaining the quotations used, when really they are quite simple to understand, while only a couple sentences delve into why she says it. If you focus more on the why, it will make your analysis much stronger. Your second body paragraph has much stronger analysis than the previous one.

{"_id": 0, "text": "The thesis does the basic job of lisiting the three rhetorical strategies, but does include the connection to Louv's arguement. That is what makes it so strong as many other essays for this piece have a thesis that simply state the rhetotrical devices without making an explicit connection to the arguement. This connection helps boost the status of this essay and puts it into upper half territory. "}
{"_id": 1, "text": "In your first paragraph, the topic sentence is not clear as to what you are trying to prove. As you state, it is ''evident'' that man has created new technologies throughout the past centuries. The rest of the body paragraphs also state the rhetorical devices Louv uses but not why he does or what he's trying to prove because he used them. The topic sentences should include Louv's claim for why he uses the rhetorical devices and how it connects to his purpose in the passage. "}
{"_id": 0, "text": "The author begins by analyzing Kelley's appeals to logos and pathos and the effect it had on Kelley's audience. They show a clear comprehension of the rhetorical devices, and also brought up the notable fact that Kelley was most likely speaking to a majority of women. They then went on to explain how Kelley appealed to the motherly aspect women posses, helping them to identify with Kelley's speech. By doing these things, the author showed deep analytical thought on all the aspects that came into play when Kelley wrote and presented her speech."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "Your explanation is very strong. Even by glancing at the essay, I can tell all three of your body paragraphs are dense. I think you could maybe take the analysis further on a few parts. For example: '''She ends with a rallying cry to action &ldquo;for the sake of the children, for the Republic&hellip; and for the sake of our cause&rdquo; (92-94). Basically, if the audience cares about children, the United States of America, or women&rsquo;s suffrage, they should follow Kelley in her crusade.'' Kelley is smart to evoke a sense a patriotism in her American audience in order to attract people to the cause. The ''if'' makes it sound by chance. In reality, Kelley knows people care about their country and this is why she chooses to say this. Try to connect your analysis more to why she would write it, and how the audience will react. Pretend as if nothing is done without a purpose. All in all, your evidence was relevant and well-explained."}
{"_id": 0, "text": "Your diction choices are very elevated and impressive for this essay. As I mentioned previously, be aware of certain ''lengthy'' sentences. For example, if I were you, the sentence, ''This generalized accusation drives the guilt knife deeper into the older population guts, forcing them to accept the idea regarding children suffering in the workplace while they sit back and do nothing,'' should be improved by shortening and making more clear and concise. Overall, there were nearly no grammar issues and your range of vocabulary was great for such a short time period to write this first draft of the essay."}

{"_id": 1, "text": "The author supports his analysis of Louv's rhetorical stratgies with a sufficient amounf of evidence. There is at least two specific evidence in each body paragraph, each circulating over Louv's main point of the separation between people and nature. I especially liked the last sentence of the first paragraph. When you describe the companies for having ''their company logo on parks'', and explain that nature is turning into a museum for the consumer population, it shows that the author fully understood the main idea of the text. But the one that that confuses me is that is the first body paragraph a factual example, a hypothetical example, or a contrast example? Due to the fact that there is nothing stating what the first paragraph is really focused on, it makes it difficult to relate back to the thesis. However, despite the absense of the title of the strategy, the paragraph itself was very well thought out. "}

The most evident word choice mishap would be in paragraph two when the author uses the word ''spew'' when discussing the manner in which Kelley presents her audience with facts. This word gives Kelley's actions a negative tone and a different word would improve the feel of the analysis. One other instance of mishap was when in paragraph three the author says ''appeals to [the audience's] pathos''. Although this makes grammatical sense, it would improve the essay to word it something like ''Kelley makes an appeal to her audience's pathos'' or ''makes an appeal to [the emotion of the audience that she is appealing to]''.
